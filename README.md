# pi-math
End of the year project

Welcome to our end of the year project! This project was created by Shay Mor and Lance Bae in June 2020.

Our program in main.py opens a tkinter window where you can perform single-digit operations. Draw your first digit in the first box, your symbol in the second (only add, subtract, multiply, and divide), and your second digit in the second box. The program will process what you drew and try to predict what you wrote!

Alternatively to digits, you can also use variables. The variables are b, c, and d. You can assign values to these variables by using the equals symbol (ex: b = 2 makes b equal to 2). Note that the variable a stores the value of your previous expression. All variables are initialized with value 0.

Please do not try to move the tkinter window around, as this will almost definitely mess up our image-capturing system; still working on a fix!

We used tensorflow and researched a lot ourselves to create the models that allow this program to work as well as it does. We used a dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/xainano/handwrittenmathsymbols) to train our models.

We hope you enjoy!
